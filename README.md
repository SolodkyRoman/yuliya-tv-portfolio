A simple portfolio website for my girlfriend who is a graphic designer.

Despite the fact that it has only two pages, I decided to experiment a little and make it without any frameworks and libraries - just with pure JS. So far, I've created a fade-in slider and a few Web Components (I've never used them and it's really interesting for me to try modern alternatives to React, Vue, etc).

The project is kind of a playground for me to try different things and face problems I don't usually face while working with React and prepared libraries.

The work is still in progress and will require final refactoring when everything is ready.
